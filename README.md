Bridge is an innovative technology based on [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/docs) which allows you to get the data you need, even when you're out of range of a cellular network!

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Run Server

To run the backend server, navigate to server and download all the required dependencies :

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then navigate to the src and run main.py on port 5000 <br>

\* Note : Personal Twilio Account needed to connect the server webhook to Twilio messaging service (API Keys and Account Credentials not provided)
